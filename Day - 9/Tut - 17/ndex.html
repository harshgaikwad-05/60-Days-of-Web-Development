    <h2>Regarding Learning Schedule for Python and Web Development</h2>

    <p>Dear Coders</p>

    <p>
        I hope you are doing well.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would like to inform you that at the moment I am unable to effectively manage
        multitasking between learning Python and Web Development simultaneously.
        Currently, I am preparing for competitive examinations and also working on
        ongoing projects, which require focused time and consistent effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        To ensure better understanding and quality learning, I have decided to first
        complete Python thoroughly. Once I finish Python and gain confidence in it,
        I will then continue with Web Development without compromising either subject.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe this step-by-step approach will help me learn more efficiently and
        deliver better results. I kindly request your understanding and support
        regarding this learning plan.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration.
    </p>
