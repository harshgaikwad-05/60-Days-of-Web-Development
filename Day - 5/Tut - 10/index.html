            Attributes for audio Tag
            src: Specifies the path to the audio file.
            controls: Adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
            autoplay: Automatically starts playing the audio when the page loads.

        </p>
        <p>
            The "preload" attribute can have the following values:

            none: This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio file at all. The
            audio file will only start downloading when the user initiates playback.

            metadata: This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of the audio file, such as its duration
            and
            basic information about the audio. This can be useful if you want to display the audio duration to the user
            without fully loading the audio data.

            auto: This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file as much as possible without delaying
            the
            loading of other important page content. The browser will try to load the audio file in the background so
            that
            it's ready to play when the user decides to start it.
