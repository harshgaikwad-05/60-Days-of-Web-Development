    <h2>What are Web Vitals?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Web Vitals</strong> are performance metrics created by Google
        to measure how users experience a website.

            Measures loading performance of the main content.
            Good score: under 2.5 seconds.

        <li>
            <strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong>
            Measures how fast the page responds to user interaction.
            Good score: under 100 milliseconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong>
            Measures visual stability of the page.
            Good score: less than 0.1.
        </li>
